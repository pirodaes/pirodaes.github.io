I was born in 1995 and ever since I've lived in Genoa, northern Italy. I moved south, to Urbino, to attend a three-years course at Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino.
There, in March 2018, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Multimedia, with a thesis on the social and cultural impact of videogames.

I am currently working on independent projects, mainly two indie videogames for mobile. Contingently I work as an illustrator on commission.
Meanwhile I am building a concept art portfolio, in order to be able, one day, to set foot into bigger videogame productions.
