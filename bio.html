My name is Léonie Aonzo, I love color stains on my hands and telling stories through images.

I am an illustrator and aspiring concept artist
based in Genoa, Italy.<br/>
I graduated from a three-years course at Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino, with a thesis on the social and cultural impact of videogames.
<br/> <br/>
Since then I’ve been taking up illustration commissions while working on an indie game for mobile.
I recently debuted in children illustration with “Like Snow”, a silent book published by Galata Edizioni.
