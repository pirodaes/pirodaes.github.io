My name is Léonie Aonzo, I love color stains on my hands and telling stories through images.
<br/><br/>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/profile.png" class="post-img-side">
I am an illustrator and aspiring concept artist born in Genoa, Italy.<br/>
I graduated from a three-years course at Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino, with a thesis on the social and cultural impact of videogames.
<br/> <br/>
Since then I’ve been taking up illustration commissions while working on an indie game for mobile.
I recently debuted in children illustration with “Like Snow”, a silent book published by Galata Edizioni.
<br/> <br/>
I am currently attending <a href="https://diploma.synstudio.ca/">Syn Studio's</a> concept art diploma program in Montreal.
